    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    1.00     12/10/2006  First OO version of the bit-board program to play      
                         a legitimate game
    1.10     04/06/2007  Some optimizations, and some other minor changes.
    1.11     04/06/2007  Fixed crash in en passant move generation, implemented
                         move take back.
    1.12     05/02/2007  Fixed bug in move generation.
    1.13     06/20/2007  Added ICGA Journal Article test code.
    1.15     11/28/2007  Added xboard compatibility mode.
    1.16     05/01/2008  Added support for Windows by catching lack of
                         signal support (thanks to Eber Ramirez).
    1.17     05/08/2008  Added some command-line features to set board position,
    1.18     05/12/2014  Remove psyco module since it is dead.
